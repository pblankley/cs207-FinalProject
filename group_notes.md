# cs207-FinalProject

A chemical kenetics module for calculating reaction rates and progress rates in elementary reactions.

Hi guys, 

Here is what I am thinking for divying up the work.

I just cleaned up the reaction_coeffs module (i.e. wrote it like a class and built out a testing suite for it).  So, that is probably the most significant modification to our code base, however we might have to add a input module for parse the xml files.  I was unclear on if that is expected by Wednesday or later in the project timeline.  Let me know your thoughts.

Here is the plan (always open to change):

Boyuan: Write the 'introduction' portion of the Model doc.  His ruberic is here https://github.com/IACS-CS-207/cs207-F17/blob/master/project/milestone1_rubric.md 
	
Also, go over my reaction_coeffs module and see if there are any changes you reccomend, and please do the same for the chemkin module feel free to change anything for either readability or performance.

Ryan: Write the 'Basic Usage and Examples' section of the Model doc. 

Also, look over the reaction_coeffs and chemkin modules and make any changes you think are beneficial (either readability or performance). 

Ryan & Boyuan:  Can one (or both) of you take care of the input file parsing? Just arbitrarily assigning parts can Ryan write the parser and Boyuan do the test suite? 

Paul: I wrote chemkin and reaction_coeffs and associated test suites, and I will be writing the Installation section of the Model doc.

(p.s. while writing this I realized he does want us to have the input parser working by Wednesday)

Let me know if you would rather do something else, cause all the current stuff I assigned for us is just arbitrary.
